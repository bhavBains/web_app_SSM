# Employee Database SSM

## Node/express server, React, mongodb

A mini web app to view and save employee data

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
2. Start the development web server using the `npm run dev` command. Both back end server and front end react server will start simultaneously.
3. The app will be served at <http://localhost:3000/>.

## To Do

- Delete and Update functionality(can be easily achieved by sending /:id along with request and using `findOneAndDelete`, `findOneAndUpdate` queries)
- Search for employee by name(or other parameters), take the input and write a query matching keyword, display result in new component
- Will work on these if needed.
